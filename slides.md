- 🙋‍♂️ **Who am I?** - And why should you even listen to me in the first place
- 🧑‍💻 **Why was this project born** - There's a reason for everything
- 🧮 **How are we going to build it** - The planning part
- 🌳 **Compilers 101** - This is the part where I sound super smart
- 🏃 **In Practice** - Talk is cheap, show me the code
- ❓ **Q/A** - Make me look smart
